  <p>Hello there and welcome to the super-simple captcha card tool!<br>
  Sadly, until I have the time to recreate the graphics generator, there are two versions of this site.<br></p>
  <p>Version 1 includes only the calculator.<br>
  Version 2 includes the calculator and graphics generator.<br></p>

  <p>If you are using chrome use <a href="noflash.html">version 1</a> or switch to a supported browser.</p>

  <p>If you are using Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge, use <a href="flash.html">version 2.</a></p>

  <p> If you are using Firefox, ensure you have the flash plugin installed. (You can get it
  <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html">here</a>.) Then use <a href="flash.html">version 2.</a></p>

  <p>If you are using some other browser, try version 2 first, and if it doesn't work, attempt version 1, or switch browsers.<br>
  Thank you, and have a nice time with the tool!</p>
