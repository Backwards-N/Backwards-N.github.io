# The Furthest Ring
The purpose of this project is to host a series of games and game-related tools, written primarily in JavaScript, and mostly relying on client-side activity.

Google Firebase will be used to handle server-side account related functionality.

Suggestions for new tools and games are welcome, and can be done on the Furthest Ring discord server [here.](https://discord.gg/jAZC9N4)

The website domain ( backwards-n.js.org ) is derived from the websiteâ€™s GH-Pages domain. The website itself should be referred to as The Furthest Ring.
