/* Comment File Revision 1

If you are reading this you must be a developer of some sort. This is the guide to sorting out my mess and reading my code.

To begin start thinking in code structures, like the parts of a planet. The types of structures I use in my code are as follows:

  Orders. These act as a set of orginizational rules you can rely on to always be the same.
  For example, Derse always comes before Prospit.

  Categorizers. These convert easily compressed memory friendly math into other code structures.
  Essentially this allows a simple boolean or number to represent information far more information than the space it takes up.
  This is only possible if orders are carefully followed.

  Lists. Lists are arrays of similar objects that can be used interchangeably.
  They are neccessary for categorizers to do their job.
