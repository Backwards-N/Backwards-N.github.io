        <h1>Player Stats Guide</h1>
        <h2>Overview:</h2>
        <p>STATS are a measurement of a player's ability. STATS are calculated based on a player's classpect, level, and BASE STATS.</p>
        <p>BASE STATS are a player's STATS before they reach the first rung of their echeladder. They are highly important as they act as a modifer to the player's stats for the rest of their life. For example, a player with a high luck BASE STAT will have incredibly high luck later on.</p>
        <p>Positive STATS represent ability in that particular area. In general, the higher value a player has in a STAT the more succesful actions requiring that STAT will be. If a character has a STAT of zero in a particular area the result of actions requiring that STAT will be determined by FATE. This is because a STAT with a value of zero represents no ability in that area.</p>
        <p>It is possible to have a negative value in a STAT. STATS with negative values represent a shortcoming in that area. The result of actions requiring negative STATS will not only be decided by FATE and LUCK but will also have a chance to critcally fail causing unfortunate side effects.</p>
        <p>When setting your player's STATS on the player creation page you are actually setting their BASE STATS. You are given a POINT POOL of 20 points to spend on your STATS. Entering a negative value into a STAT BOX adds extra points to your POINT POOL (With the execption of bad luck, explained below.) The value displayed below the STAT BOX will be the player's STATS at level one.</p>
        <p>For a list of how classes and aspects affect certain stats see classpect stat calculator here.</p>
        <h2>Gel Viscosity: </h2>
        <p>Gel Viscosity measures a player's ability to take damage. When this STAT reaches zero, the player fails to be alive. This stat is not affected by base stats.</p>
        <p>Gel Viscosity can be replenished by absorbing Viscosity Gels. These gels are not hard to come by and can be found anywhere grist can be found. Like any game abstraction, viscosity gels cannot be alchemized.</p>
        <h2>Mangrit: </h2>
        <p>Mangrit measures a player's physical strength. Mangrit determines the damage a player can do (unaided by their classpect) as well as deciding the weight of weapon they can wield. It is useful for moving heavy obstacles.</p>
        <p>Having a negative mangrit STAT can prove fatal in many situations and is therefore not advised. If your player starts the game with a negative mangrit STAT ensure that they are well protected and keep them away from heavy objects until they have risen farther up their echeladder.</p>
        <p>While mangrit is an important STAT for all players, this is especially true for those specializing in combat.</p>
        <h2>Speed:</h2>
        <p>Speed measures how quickly a player can travel as well as measuring a player's overall reaction speed. Speed is used when calculating the number of rounds it will take a player to travel a long distance. This can heavily affect the outcome of many game-changing situations, such as those that require speedy travel between planets.</p>
        <p>Several things during STRIFE are influenced by speed. Turn order is decided primarily by this STAT, going from fastest to lowest. High speed values also help when dodging and making counterattacks.</p>
        <h2>Stealth:</h2>
        <p>Stealth measures how easily a player can avoid detection. Stealth factors into many things too numerous to list here (but I might list later, in its own guide). Incredibly stealthy players can even avoid their server player's viewport and can keep other players from seeing when they've performed an action.</p>
        <p>Negative stealth actually draws attention towards the player, which can be useful at times.</p>
        <h2>Willpower:</h2>
        <p>Willpower measures a player's ability to fight FATE. Players with high willpower are likely to disobey your instructions to do their own thing and players with negative willpower are likely to ignore you to complete their destiny.</p>
        <h2>Good Luck:</h2>
        <p>Good luck measures a player's chances of winning on a LUCK ROLL. LUCK ROLLS happen whenever a player is looking for a good result.</p>
        <h2>Bad Luck:</h2>
        <p>Bad luck measures a player's chances of having a BAD BREAK. BAD BREAKS occur whenever a player fails spectacularly at something, in a way that actually makes negative progress (such as being killed by your own attack). As such, positive BASE bad luck adds points to your POINT POOL.</p>
